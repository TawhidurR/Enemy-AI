Welcome to the EnemyAI game! In this project, I programmed the AI for enemy players in a 2D top-down game. The goal was to make the enemies competitive by implementing various AI behaviors, such as finding the closest player, avoiding walls, and making strategic decisions.

Game Overview:
- The game is 2D and top-down.
- Players can move using WASD or arrow keys and fire projectiles with the space bar.
- Enemy characters fire projectiles when in close proximity and will attempt to dodge yours. They are capable of tracking you down and playing strategically such as avoiding obstacles.

To play the game:
- Run the game.GameServer file.
- Open frontend/index.html in a browser.
- Use arrow keys (or WASD) to move and the space bar to fire.


Skeleton code was provided as this was a project in my CS class. My main objective in the project was developing the AI and behavior of the enemy characters to find close players, make decisions, avoid walls, etc. My program is in game.enemyai.AIPlayer.
